# Savorys Landing Page

A fictional landing page for a cafe that sells THC Infused Green Coffee. I always wanted to create an eCommerce application but couldn't devote the time to creating an entire site. I wanted to focus on not only development but also design and copy. It was a fun project that I got to learn a lot from.

## Obstacles

This was my first time working on an eCommerce application so I had to do tons of reading, between Commerce.js and Stripe documentation, and wrapping my brain around how to best incorporate these APIs with my design was fairly challenging but rewarding non the less.

#### What I've Done:

- Built reusable UI components.
- Implemented Commerce.js headless API into the application.
- Integrated Stripe API with Commerce.js to handle customer purchases.
- Managed Cart state with useReducers and Context
- Successfully implement logic to securely process payment.
